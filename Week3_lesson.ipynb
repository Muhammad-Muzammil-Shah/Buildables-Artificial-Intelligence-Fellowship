    "\n",
    "## 1. Use Case  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why this use case?  \n",
    "Many students struggle with mathematics concepts because they do not have immediate access to teachers or tutors outside class hours.  \n",
    "An AI-powered Q&A bot can instantly answer their questions, explain concepts, and provide step-by-step solutions in real time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Target Users  \n",
    "- School and college students needing math support  \n",
    "- Self-learners preparing for exams (SAT, GRE, etc.)  \n",
    "- Teachers who want a digital assistant for solving practice questions  \n",
    "- Parents helping children with homework  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Benefits  \n",
    "- Instant explanations for math concepts and problems  \n",
    "- Step-by-step solutions for better understanding  \n",
    "- 24/7 availability, unlike human tutors  \n",
    "- Can adapt explanations to different difficulty levels (basic to advanced)  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations  \n",
    "- Cannot replace real teachers for deeper conceptual guidance  \n",
    "- May misinterpret complex handwritten equations  \n",
    "- Limited to text-based or typed math input  \n",
    "- Relies on training data, may not cover very advanced or niche math topics  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Justification  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is this problem worth solving?  \n",
    "Mathematics is a subject where doubts build up quickly if not resolved immediately. Students often lose confidence when they cannot understand solutions.  \n",
    "This bot provides **real-time, structured explanations** so learners can continue studying without delay.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why a chatbot instead of apps/humans?  \n",
    "- Faster than searching through textbooks or websites  \n",
    "- Available anytime, unlike teachers or tutors  \n",
    "- Encourages self-paced learning  \n",
    "- Anonymous, allowing students to ask “basic” questions without hesitation  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Specific tasks the bot will perform  \n",
    "- Solve algebra, calculus, geometry, and arithmetic problems step by step  \n",
    "- Explain mathematical concepts in simple language  \n",
    "- Provide practice problems with hints  \n",
    "- Share references (e.g., Khan Academy, Wolfram Alpha)  \n",
    "- Encourage logical reasoning instead of giving only final answers  \n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. LLM Choice (Groq)  \n",
    "I chose **llama-3.1-8b-instant** because:  \n",
    "- **Real-time responses** → students get answers quickly during study sessions  \n",
    "- **Efficient & lightweight** → faster than larger models like mixtral-8x7b  \n",
    "- **Multilingual support** → useful for students learning math in different languages  \n",
    "- **Optimized for chat-based Q&A** → natural interaction with learners  \n",
    "\n",
    "If advanced symbolic reasoning is needed, the system can integrate with **Wolfram Alpha API** or upgrade to **mixtral-8x7b**.  \n",

    "## 4. Conversation Flow  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample Dialogues  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Greeting**  \n",
    "- User: “Hello”  \n",
    "- Bot: “Hi! I’m your Math Helper Bot. What topic in mathematics are you studying today?”  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Algebra Question**  \n",
    "- User: “Solve 2x + 5 = 15.”  \n",
    "- Bot: “Sure! Let’s solve step by step:  \n",
    "  2x + 5 = 15  \n",
    "  Subtract 5 from both sides → 2x = 10  \n",
    "  Divide by 2 → x = 5”  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Concept Explanation**  \n",
    "- User: “What is a derivative?”  \n",
    "- Bot: “A derivative measures how a function changes when its input changes.  \n",
    "  Example: The derivative of x² is 2x, which means slope increases with x.”  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Geometry Question**  \n",
    "- User: “Find the area of a circle with radius 7.”  \n",
    "- Bot: “The formula is A = πr².  \n",
    "  Substituting r = 7 → A = π × 7² = 49π ≈ 153.94.”  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Unknown Question**  \n",
    "- User: “Tell me about world history.”  \n",
    "- Bot: “Sorry, I can only help with math-related questions.”  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Goodbye**  \n",
    "- User: “Thanks!”  \n",
    "- Bot: “You’re welcome! Keep practicing math, and ask me anytime you need help.”  \n",
    "\n",
